# Beatrice's Analytics Portfolio

Hey! Welcome to my portfolio. I've tried to showcase most of my work here, you'll find link to the repositories of each project.

## [Spotify Skipping Behavior - Python](https://github.com/beatriceftomasello/SpotifySkippingBehavior.git)

The goal of this project is to predict if a user will skip a song (or not), using as our Y the variable ‘Not_skipped’, understanding if and how much our output variable is dependent on the features included in our dataset. While there is a large related body of work on recommendation algorithms, there is very little work, or data, describing how users sequentially interact with the streamed content they are presented with. In particular within music, the question of if, and when, a user skips a track is an important implicit feedback signal. In order to get this feedback we developed our analysis and prediction based on supervised machine learning models: we used Logistic Regression, which we concluded applying Ridge and Lasso regression, and the Regression Tree model, together with the Random Forest. 


## [London Restaurant Scene - R](https://github.com/beatriceftomasello/LondonRestaurantScene.git)

This analysis has been carried out using R and a datasets about London's restaurant scene. The dataset contained restaurant variables such as rating, location, prices of the items on the menu and delivery times. I've developed the analysis around some business related questions, plus a section of open analysis that I’ve chosen to conduct on the restaurant names and the Londoners food preferences. I have finally created a map showing the restaurants distribution in the London area.

## [Shakespearian Plays Text Mining - Python](https://github.com/beatriceftomasello/ShakespearianPlays.git)

In this project, I have analyzed a .csv file containing lines from 36 Shakespearian plays. After cleaning the dataset, removing stopwords and punctuation, I have creayed a word cloud and a visualization of the words frequency. I have analyzed the length of the plays in number of lines, the number of characters in each play, and I have conducted a simple sentiment analysis on a sample of 100 lines extracted from the dataset.
