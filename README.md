# Beatrice's Analytics Portfolio

Hey! Welcome to my portfolio.

## [Spotify Skipping Behavior - Python](https://github.com/beatriceftomasello/SpotifySkippingBehavior.git)

The goal for our models is to predict the behavior user for skipping or not a song, using as our Y the variable ‘Not_skipped’, understanding if and how much our output variable is dependent on the features included in our dataset. While there is a large related body of work on recommender systems, there is very little work, or data, describing how users sequentially interact with the streamed content they are presented with. In particular within music, the question of if, and when, a user skips a track is an important implicit feedback signal. In order to get this feedback we developed our analysis and prediction based on supervised machine learning models: we used Logistic Regression, which we concluded applying Ridge and Lasso regression, and the Regression Tree model, together with the Random Forest. 


## [London Restaurant Scene - R](https://github.com/beatriceftomasello/LondonRestaurantScene.git)

As part of the Mibe x LSU challenge, this analysis has been carried out using R and the datasets provided. The analysis subject is the London restaurant scene, defined by restaurant variables such as rating, location, prices of the items on the menu and delivery times. As asked in the challenge, the analysis goes on around some business related questions provided in the challenge, plus a section of open analysis that I’ve chosen to conduct around the restaurant names, the Londoners food preferences and finally the creation of a map showing the restaurants distribution in the Lonodn area.

## Shakespearian Plays Text Mining - Pyhton 

In this project, I have analyzed a .csv file containing lines from 36 Shakespearian plays. After cleaning the dataset, removing stopwords and punctuation, I have creayed a word cloud and a visualization of the words frequency. I have analyzed the length of the plays in number of lines, the number of characters in each play, and I have conducted a simple sentiment analysis on a sample of 100 lines extracted from the dataset.
